Version 0.7.1 fixes a (possibly breaking) build issue with 0.7; no other changes apply, so it is *a drop-in replacement* for the previous version. Apologies for the mess!

* [#117](https://github.com/wix/accord/pull/117) Bug: Upgrade from 0.6.1 to 0.7 produces strange FileNotFoundException errors (reported by [@dpalinic](https://github.com/dpalinic))
