package com.wix.accord

/** Adds support for [[java.time.temporal.Temporal temporals]] (and subclasses) to the Accord DSL.
  *
  * ==Usage==
  *
  * To use these extensions, import this package as follows:
  *
  * {{{
  *   import java.time.LocalDateTime
  *   import java.time.temporal.ChronoUnit
  *   import java.time.Duration
  *
  *   case class Person( name: String, birthDate: LocalDateTime )
  *
  *   // Import the Accord DSL and Java 8 extensions...
  *   import com.wix.accord.dsl._
  *   import com.wix.accord.java8._
  *
  *   // LocalDateTime (and other temporals) are now supported
  *   implicit val personValidator = validator[ Person ] { p =>
  *     p.name is notEmpty
  *     p.birthDate is before( LocalDateTime.now )
  *   }
  * }}}
  *
  * ==Combinators==

  * Supported operations:
  *
  * {{{
  *   // Simple equality/inequality
  *   val lastYear = LocalDateTime.now.minus( 1L, ChronoUnit.YEARS )
  *   p.birthDate is equalTo( lastYear )
  *   p.birthDate is notEqualTo( lastYear )
  *
  *   // Equality with tolerance (both variants are equivalent)
  *   val oneWeek = Duration.ofDays( 7L )
  *   p.birthDate is within( oneWeek ).of( lastYear )
  *   p.birthDate is within( 7L, ChronoUnit.DAYS ).of( lastYear )
  *
  *   // Before/after
  *   val ageOfAdulthood = LocalDateTime.now.minus( 18L, ChronoUnit.YEARS )
  *   p.birthDate is before( ageOfAdulthood )
  *   p.birthDate is after( ageOfAdulthood )
  *
  *   // Arithmetic-style operations
  *   p.birthDate must be <= ageOfAdulthood
  *   p.birthDate is between( lastYear, LocalDateTime.now.minus( oneWeek ) )
  * }}}
